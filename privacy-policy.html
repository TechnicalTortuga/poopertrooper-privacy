        <h2>12. Third-Party Links</h2>

        <p>
            California residents: Under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), you have the right to know what personal information is collected and how it is used.

        </p>

        <h2>14. European Users (GDPR)</h2>
        <p>
            If you are in the European Economic Area (EEA), you have certain rights under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR):
